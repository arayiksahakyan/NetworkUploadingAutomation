Endpoint Documentation:
For specific tasks like video uploads, refer to the Graph API's "Video" or "Media" sections. These segments of the documentation provide guidance on required endpoints, request formats, and expected responses.
Graph API Explorer:
Take advantage of the Graph API Explorer for interactive API request testing. This tool facilitates experimentation with various parameters, comprehension of API response structures, and testing of permissions.
Permissions and Access Tokens:
Determine the permissions your application necessitates. For video uploads to a Facebook page, permissions such as pages_read_engagement, pages_manage_posts, and pages_manage_media are often essential. These permissions can be requested through your app's dashboard on Facebook for Developers and must be granted by the user or page administrator.

Authentication:
Different platforms utilize various authentication methods:
OAuth: Common for user-centric actions, involving redirecting users to a login page to obtain an access token for API calls on their behalf.
API Key: Simpler than OAuth, directly used in API calls for user-specific or general actions, depending on the access level required.
Read Documentation:
Before coding, thoroughly review the API documentation, which typically provides:
Endpoint URLs for API requests.
Required Parameters, such as video files, text, or tags.
Rate Limits specifying the number of requests allowed within a given time frame.
Data Formats for request formatting and expected response formats.
Set Up Environment:
Ensure security and convenience in API usage:
Securely store API keys and secrets, such as in environment variables or a secure vault.
Utilize libraries supporting the API's authentication mechanism, like requests_oauthlib for OAuth in Python.
Example: Twitter API Registration
For platforms like Twitter, follow these steps:

Visit the Twitter Developer Portal.
Sign in and create a new app in the Projects & Apps section.
